## How the Loyalty Program Works

Users are added to the loyalty program when they meet the criteria during a **successful purchase**. The criteria include minimum spending amount, minimum items purchased, and/or user roles. These are evaluated only when an order is completed successfully.

### Stored Data:
- Loyalty status.
- Last activity date.
- Joining date.
- Total spent amount.
- Total item count.

All this data is saved in the user's meta information and used exclusively by the plugin. You can modify a userâ€™s loyalty status directly via the **Admin User Menu** at any time.

## Discount System

The plugin provides two types of discounts based on cart contents:

1. **Percentage-Based Discount**  
2. **Fixed Amount Discount**

### Exclusion Options:
- Discounts can be disabled for carts containing sale items.
- Coupons can optionally be disabled when a discount is applied.

### Loyalty Discounts:
- Define criteria for a user to qualify for the loyalty program:
  - Minimum spending amount.
  - Minimum purchased items.
  - User roles.

- Customize the relationship between the criteria:
  - Require at least one condition to be met, or all conditions.

- Automatically assign one or more free gift products to loyalty customers.

## Periodic Discount System

- **Target Amount**: Specify the spending threshold that users must reach.

## CHANGELOG

### V 1.1 *2024.12.18*

* The inactivity system did not respect the unique purchase amount and item values (provided by the plugin), and deleted them even if they were not enabled. Fixed
* **New** feature for loyal customers! 

**Free Shipping option**
You can now make **free shipping** to loyal customers. 
Create a free shipping method and select the Loyalty program member option in the requirements field.
You can also combine it with woocommerce's *minimum order amount* setting, because it takes into account.

### V 1.0 *2024.11.18.*

* Initial release
